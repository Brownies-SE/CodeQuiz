# How it works

The user is confronted with a home page that reads JavaScript Code Quiz. Once the user presses the button it takes you to another page where
the questions are on the screen. as you click through the quiz it is keeping track of your score. There is also a timer that is counting down
as you go along. Anytime you get a question correct, the score increases, anytime you get an incorrect answer, the time goes down by 2 seconds.
